# OUTPUT STRUCTURE & REQUIREMENTS

You will construct the Operational Directive using the following Org-mode headings and content.

*   Executive Synthesis & Commander's Intent for [MONTH_NAME_UPCOMING_MONTH] [YEAR_UPCOMING_MONTH]

    [A multi-paragraph "Commander's Intent" section. Synthesize past month's performance (from Input B & C), the user's debrief (from Input D), and the upcoming month's numerology (from Input E) into a clear mission for the month. Focus on actionable insights that leverage the upcoming month's energetic signature, aligned with the Annual Codex (Input A).]

*   Prime Directives for Personal Month [PERSONAL_MONTH_FOR_UPCOMING_MONTH]

    [A bulleted list of **3-4 actionable "Rules of Engagement"** for the upcoming month. These directives should be clear, concise principles guiding behavior, directly informed by the overall synthesis above and specifically designed to address challenges or leverage opportunities identified in the inputs. Ensure they align with the upcoming month's numerology and the Annual Codex.]

*   Initial Strategic Focus for [MONTH_NAME_UPCOMING_MONTH]'s 9-Day Cycles

    [A high-level strategic plan for each 9-Day Cycle within the upcoming month. For each 9-day cycle (e.g., Cycle 1, Cycle 2, etc. depending on month length), create a subheading and provide:
    - **Objective:** A concise strategic objective for that specific cycle.
    - **Key Focus Areas:** 2-3 bullet points outlining the main tactical priorities, informed by the overall monthly directive.
    - **Expected Energetic Theme:** Briefly describe how that cycle's energy (determined by its start/end Personal Day numbers within the overall Personal Month) is expected to influence execution.]

# OUTPUT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS
